# DevCBatch1Project

Big thanks to https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter for helping me to create a web app without learning JS from scratch ^^!

This is my very first project. It's all about house pricing and for B2B's platform... and after I listened to a real estate agent how to predict a house's price, I've made 3 steps:
  1. First page: Checking the average price of houses based on area that the agent's looking for.
  2. Second page: Checking the exact address of the house on Google Maps and all nearby markets, bus stations, schools, drugstores,...
  3. Third page: Checking the estimated price of the house based on the house's features showed on screen. (The greatest one)

Real estate agents will know how much is the price after doing step 1 and step 2, then they can confirm again with step 3 or step 3 will help them to price if there're some reasons 
like they don't know much about houses there, can't make the decision,... Or just skip step 1 and step 2 ^^!

How to check my web:
  1. Clone it.
  2. Go to "Flask" folder, open Terminal and type "python install -r requirements.txt" then "python main.py".
  3. Go back to project's folder, open Terminal then type "npm start".
  Make sure that you have installed Python 3 and Node.js on your device ^^!
 
 I've put in some other features in this web like users can send back houses's information for the model to predict better,... but it just stopped at "web programming" step. So wait 
 for other commits ^^!

Btw, my notebook for data processing and model building is below: https://github.com/GumballWatterson00/HousePricingUsingBlendedRegressors
